                    <p>I&#8217;ve been <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;ing at swing and blues dances for a while now. It&#8217;s extremely fun
and rewarding. I&#8217;ve got a system that I use to keep myself sane while doing it
and I felt like sharing. Let me know what&nbsp;you&nbsp;think!</p>

<h2 id="how-i-started">How&nbsp;I&nbsp;Started</h2>
<p>When I was just starting to get really interested in dancing I didn&#8217;t think
I&#8217;d want to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> much. I thought it would be a lot of work and that I&#8217;d hate
having to stay near a computer during a dance. It just didn&#8217;t seem like very&nbsp;much&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>The only reason I began to try my hand at it was because we needed to have
good music to play at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RIT</span></span> Swing Dance Club when my old roommates and I started
teaching there. I wanted the other people to have a good time and hear the
awesome music that we love dancing to. I figured that it didn&#8217;t need to be a
big deal; I&#8217;d just find some cool music and play it&nbsp;at&nbsp;club.</p>
<p>Once I started, I realized that I really like being able to play great music
for other people to dance to. It sounds cliche, but it really <em>is</em> rewarding.
There&#8217;s something special about having a kind of control over an entire&nbsp;dance&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>After I became comfortable <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;ing at club it was only a matter of time before
I started <a href="http://lindyjam.com/schedule/">signing up to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span></a> at <a href="http://lindyjam.com/">Lindy Jam</a> and then playing music at
our little blues parties. I love it. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;ing is good for me &mdash; it forces
me to look for interesting new music and really <em>listen</em> to it to hear how it
works. Really listening (without dancing) closely to swing or blues music is
something that I don&#8217;t think enough&nbsp;dancers&nbsp;do.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-find-music">Where Do I&nbsp;Find&nbsp;Music?</h2>
<p>Most of the music I play comes from <a href="http://emusic.com/">eMusic</a>. It&#8217;s a great site &mdash; you
pay $15 and get about 40 tracks per month. That&#8217;s far cheaper than iTunes and
it&#8217;s all <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span>-free mp3 files. They have a great collection of jazz and blues
(and a lot of indie and classical music too). I highly recommend them if
you&#8217;re looking for some&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;music.</p>
<p>Previously I&#8217;ve wanted nothing to do with iTunes because of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span>.
Thankfully Apple has announced that they&#8217;ve convinced the record labels to
allow <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DRM</span></span>-free downloads of everything. I&#8217;ll still get most of my music from
eMusic (it&#8217;s cheaper) but if they don&#8217;t have a song I want I&#8217;ll definitely
look&nbsp;on&nbsp;iTunes.</p>
<p>As for CDs and vinyl, I do occasionally buy and rip some, but for the most
part digital music is simply faster, easier, and cheaper&nbsp;to&nbsp;use.</p>
<h2 id="sorting-my-music">Sorting&nbsp;My&nbsp;Music</h2>
<p>Over the past couple of years I&#8217;ve turned into a pretty organized person. If I
don&#8217;t have a good method of sorting and organizing my music I&#8217;ll go crazy when
I try to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>. I&#8217;ve developed a way of organizing everything over the years I&#8217;ve
been <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;ing which seems to work pretty well&nbsp;for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h3 id="danceable-music"><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>Danceable&#8221;&nbsp;Music</h3>
<p>The first thing I do when I download a new <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CD</span></span> from eMusic is skim each track
and decide if it&#8217;s even remotely danceable. If it&#8217;s got a beat I can dance to
at all, it goes into my &#8220;Lindy <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Blues&#8221; playlist in iTunes. I don&#8217;t worry
about how good the song is &mdash; the important part for me is getting the
decent songs into that playlist so I don&#8217;t forget&nbsp;about&nbsp;them.</p>
<h3 id="tempo">Tempo</h3>
<p>My next step is tagging danceable songs with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> (beats per minute)
information. This is really nice to know when you&#8217;re out at a dane and
thinking: &#8220;I should play a song that&#8217;s a bit faster than that&nbsp;last&nbsp;one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve experimented with a couple of different methods in the past but they all
seemed pretty cumbersome. The solution came in the form of this <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Dashboard-Widgets/Music/Tempo-Widget.shtml">Tempo
Widget</a> for my Mac&#8217;s dashboard. Click the button on each beat, double click
the numbers to save the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> to the currently playing&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s not enough for a nerd like me. The mouse is so slow;
what I really needed was a way to use the keyboard for everything so I could
fly through tagging my songs in less than 15 seconds each. I opened up the
code for the widget and added a couple things. I can press any key on a beat
instead of clicking the button, and I can hit Cmd+S to save the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> to the
iTunes song instead of double clicking&nbsp;the&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>I also use <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> to add keyboard shortcuts to move to the
next/previous song in iTunes. Now that I&#8217;ve got all that done, when I want to
tag a bunch of new songs with BPMs I can&nbsp;do&nbsp;this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start playing the first song and open up&nbsp;the&nbsp;dashboard.</li>
<li>Press any key on each beat until I have a consistent <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span>&nbsp;displaying.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+S to save the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> to&nbsp;the&nbsp;song.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+Option+Ctrl+Right Arrow to move to the&nbsp;next&nbsp;song.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-5 for&nbsp;each&nbsp;song.</li>
</ol>
<p>It usually takes me 15 seconds or less per song and saves me a ton of time (I
have about 900 songs tagged with BPMs right now!). If you&#8217;re interested in my
modified version of the Tempo Widget let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know.</p>
<h3 id="rating-smartly">Rating&nbsp;(Smartly)</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: some songs are better than others. Some songs are fun to dance
to, but others almost <em>force</em> you out of your seat. I like to be able to
glance at my playlist and have a rough idea of which <em>really awesome</em> songs
I&#8217;ve got at a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;tempo.</p>
<p>Some people might say: &#8220;You should know all of your music by heart and
shouldn&#8217;t need to rely on ratings.&#8221; I disagree &mdash; maybe I&#8217;m just not as
diligent in studying but there&#8217;s no way I could remember every single song in
my playlist. Of course you should know your music, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you
can&#8217;t use whatever tools you like to make your <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;ing even more effective.
Ratings help me remember to play a song that I might otherwise have forgotten
about and let me see what my options are if I really need a fantastic song
<em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t start rating my danceable songs until a month or two
ago and so I&#8217;m only about halfway through. One thing that helps is iTunes&#8217;
Smart Playlists. I can create a smart playlist that only shows me songs that
are in my &#8220;Lindy <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Blues&#8221; playlist but aren&#8217;t&nbsp;yet&nbsp;rated.</p>
<p><img alt="Unrated Smart Playlist Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2009/02/dj-playlist-unrated.png" title="Unrated Smart Playlist" /></p>
<p>I have an iPod as well, so when I&#8217;m out and listening to my music I can set
the rating right on the iPod. When I get back to my computer I plug in the
iPod and it syncs the ratings back to iTunes&nbsp;for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h2 id="at-a-dance">At&nbsp;a&nbsp;Dance</h2>
<p>All of the steps I&#8217;ve talked about so far have one goal: to make playing great
music at an actual&nbsp;dance&nbsp;easier.</p>
<h3 id="previewing">Previewing</h3>
<p>I rarely preview songs before I play them; I know my collection pretty well
and usually have a good idea whether or not a song will fit. Still, it&#8217;s
definitely nice to be able to hear a song now&nbsp;and&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>Some <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>&#8217;s really love external sound cards which let you have two music
players open on your machine; one plays the music going to the room speakers
and the other plays into a set of headphones. I don&#8217;t use this setup for a&nbsp;few&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t be bothered to buy an external sound card.  I know,&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;lazy.</li>
<li>Computers are tricky, and adding another sound card into the mix makes
  things trickier. Having another audio interface often causes some headaches
  when you&#8217;re ready to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> and no sound is coming out of one port because
  there&#8217;s a configuration option messed&nbsp;up&nbsp;somewhere.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t trust myself. I can easily see myself accidentally trying to preview
  on the music player that&#8217;s going to&nbsp;the&nbsp;room.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I do instead? I use my iPod. Sure, the interface isn&#8217;t as easy to
navigate as a music player on a laptop, but it doesn&#8217;t cost any extra money (I
have it anyway) and there&#8217;s no chance of accidentally messing up the currently&nbsp;playing&nbsp;song.</p>
<h3 id="running-playlists">Running&nbsp;Playlists</h3>
<p>Throughout the night as I decide which songs I want to play I put them in two
separate lists. First they go into my &#8220;Short List&#8221; which is usually around
five to ten songs that I think I&#8217;ll want to play fairly soon. That gives me
easy access to songs I&#8217;ll probably&nbsp;play&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Running&#8221; playlist is the one that&#8217;s actually playing through the
speakers. I usually have one or two songs queued up ahead of time in case I
get distracted from my laptop for&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<h3 id="sorting-on-the-fly">Sorting on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Fly</h3>
<p>All the work I put into tagging and rating my music pays off when I&#8217;m actually
trying to decide what to play next. When I&#8217;m looking through my collection my
iTunes window will usually look like this (except for being slightly bigger
and having the&nbsp;sidebar&nbsp;showing):</p>
<p><img alt="Sorted Danceable Playlist Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2009/02/dj-playlist-sorting.png" title="Sorted Danceable Playlist" /></p>
<p>I can use the search bar in the upper right if I&#8217;m looking for something
specific. I can sort by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BPM</span></span> if I know I want a song at a rough tempo. The
ratings draw my eyes to the songs that I love the most. The comments are there
to remind me about songs that have long intro/outros, double timed sections,
etc. Having all of that at my fingers makes it much easier for me to find
exactly what I want and get it to&nbsp;the&nbsp;speakers.</p>
<h2 id="and-so">And&nbsp;So&#8230;</h2>
<p>I wrote this because I wanted to share how and why I <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> for dancers. If you&#8217;re
a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span>, I hope I&#8217;ve given you a couple of ideas for new tricks to make your job
easier. <strong>Let me know what you think on <a href="http://twitter.com/stevelosh/">Twitter</a>!</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> but think you might want to, great! Please don&#8217;t be scared off
by my absurdly organized workflow &mdash; just because it works for me doesn&#8217;t
mean you have to do it. Find some good music and <a href="http://lindyjam.com/schedule/">sign up to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> at Lindy
Jam</a>! If you think two hours is too long for you as when you&#8217;re first
learning to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DJ</span></span> just ask myself, Matt, Jesse, Mike or Beth if we&#8217;ll share the
night half <span class="amp">&amp;</span> half with you. If you have any questions please let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know!</p>
