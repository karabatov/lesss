                    <p>Well, I&#8217;ve finally taken the plunge and made this site open source. It&#8217;s held
in a <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> repository, but you can view or download the source code
from <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/stevelosh/">http://bitbucket.org/sjl/stevelosh/</a> without any&nbsp;special&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>The site was built with the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework. If you want to know more
check out the <a href="/projects/stevelosh-com">project page</a>. This post isn&#8217;t going to duplicate what&#8217;s
there; instead I want to write about why I made the site open source at all.
There are a couple of main reasons, and not <em>all</em> of them&nbsp;are&nbsp;selfish!</p>
<h2 id="i-get-more-traffic">I Get&nbsp;More&nbsp;Traffic</h2>
<p>The first reason to make a site open source is to try to get more hits. You
certainly don&#8217;t <em>lose</em> any hits from doing it, and when developers find your
link on places like <a href="http://djangosites.org/">DjangoSites</a> they might be more inclined to visit if
they knew they could look at the source&nbsp;code&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>You also have the chance to post on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, or other places
about the source code of the site. Each of those posts can expose more people
to the website. It&#8217;s easy to overdo this though. I heartily agree with the
sentiments of <a href="http://howtousetwitterformarketingandpr.com">howtousetwitterformarketingandpr.com</a> on&nbsp;that&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t be obnoxious&nbsp;about&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="i-can-give-back-to-the-programming-community">I Can Give Back to the&nbsp;(Programming)&nbsp;Community</h2>
<p>Yeah, I know.  It sounds cliched, but it&#8217;s true.<br />
</p>
<p>The open source community has produced a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of software, some
of which we use every day. Software like <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and countless
others simply wouldn&#8217;t exist in anything remotely close to their&nbsp;current&nbsp;forms.</p>
<p>Being able to look at the source code for a particular project can be
extremely helpful to someone trying to learn how to do something similar.
Instead of firing up an email client and sending a message to the creator they
can simply look at how it works themselves. They can download it, tweak it,
break it, and figure out what makes it tick. There&#8217;s no substitute&nbsp;for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that the world would be a better place if everyone shared
their knowledge (in all fields) and we all learned from each other. In some
cases it&#8217;s simply not practical, but more often than not I think people want
to horde their knowledge and feel superior. Sure, that might be nice for your
ego, but does it really make the world a happier, more beautiful place&nbsp;to&nbsp;live?</p>
<h2 id="i-might-get-free-code">I Might Get&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Code!</h2>
<p>Well, probably not, but who knows? Maybe some developer has a lot of free time
on his or&nbsp;her&nbsp;hands?</p>
<p>Distributed version control systems like <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> make it extremely easy
to help out with open source projects. For example, if you were looking
through my code and saw a bug that you wanted to fix, you could do&nbsp;the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository to your own machine. * Fix the bug in that local copy,
committing to your local repository as you go. * Go back to the website and
click the &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; button. * I review the changes. * If I like them I
press a button to merge them into the&nbsp;main&nbsp;repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the changes are in the main repository I just run a single script to
redeploy the site as usual and the changes are live. It&#8217;s really an almost
painless process. Compare that to something like Subversion or (ick)&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">CVS</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the repository to your&nbsp;own&nbsp;machine.</li>
<li>Fix the bug in that local copy, without committing (don&#8217;t&nbsp;mess&nbsp;up!).</li>
<li>Create a patch using diff or&nbsp;something&nbsp;similar.</li>
<li>Email me&nbsp;the&nbsp;patch.</li>
<li>I review&nbsp;the&nbsp;changes.</li>
<li>If I like them I check out a fresh copy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;repository.</li>
<li>I apply the patch to&nbsp;this&nbsp;copy.</li>
<li>I merge the patch back into the&nbsp;main&nbsp;repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s much more difficult because I don&#8217;t want to just give any anonymous
person commit access to&nbsp;my&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="it-makes-me-fix-my-damn-code">It Makes Me Fix My&nbsp;Damn&nbsp;Code</h2>
<p>This is probably the most tangible and important benefit of my open sourcing
this site. It forced me to rewrite parts of the code that weren&#8217;t secure and
do it the&nbsp;right&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Passwords stored in source control? Yeah, <em>definitely</em> a&nbsp;bad&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>Of course, it <em>was</em> kind of a pain in the ass to refactor a bunch of stuff.
Really, though, the main problem I had was my own procrastination and going
open source was a good nudge. Plus when I start work on another site I&#8217;ll know
how to do it right the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Aside from major security and privacy issues, it also gives me a big incentive
to clean up my code and make it more elegant. Clean, elegant code makes me
happy. It&#8217;s less likely to have bugs (because there are fewer places for them
to hide) and it&#8217;s far easier to maintain in the&nbsp;long&nbsp;run.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also simply more fun to read and&nbsp;work&nbsp;with.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-probably-try-it">You Should Probably&nbsp;Try&nbsp;It</h2>
<p>Obviously not all software is appropriate for open sourcing, but if you&#8217;ve got
a pet project that you&#8217;ve been working and you think it might benefit from a
few more sets of eyes,&nbsp;try&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to spend money or configure much of anything to share your
code; sites like <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> and <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> offer free hosting and great
interfaces for repositories of open&nbsp;source&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments I&#8217;d love to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;them!</p>
