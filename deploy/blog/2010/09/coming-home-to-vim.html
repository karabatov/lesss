                    <p>I&#8217;m a programmer. I work with text files for 6-12 hours every weekday so I care
about the text editor I use. If switching to a different editor can increase my
efficiency by even 10% it would save a good chunk of my time and let me get
back to making&nbsp;cool&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the &#8220;you&#8217;re thinking 90% of the time and only typing 10% of the
time, so your editor doesn&#8217;t really matter&#8221; argument. Even if the premise is
true, the conclusion&nbsp;is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>If I think for 10 minutes and then start typing, I want the typing to take the
shortest time possible so I can get back to thinking. Any time I spend typing
is an interruption that I want to minimize so I can keep my train&nbsp;of&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>I recently started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> as my primary editor. As I&#8217;m adjusting I&#8217;m
finding a lot of <a href="http://jeetworks.org/node/89">the</a> <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html">blog</a> <a href="http://wekeroad.com/2010/07/29/vim-is-your-daddy/">posts</a> <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">people</a>

<h2 id="some-background-about-me">Some Background&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</h2>
<p>I used Vim exclusively from about 2002 to 2005. I never really learned much
about it and mostly used it as a glorified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_(text_editor)">nano</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 I decided it was time for a change. I wanted an editor that &#8220;fit&#8221; with
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X. I tried <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> for a while and it was kind of cool. The
collaborative editing was more polished than any other version I&#8217;ve seen,
though I didn&#8217;t have much use&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>As cool as SubEthaEdit was, I always felt like there was a better editor out
there for me. Then I found <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.</p>
<p>At the time I thought TextMate was amazing (and it really was). It <em>looked</em>
like a Mac application. It was super easy to learn (all the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X text movement
commands just worked). There were bundles&nbsp;for&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>I still used Vim occasionally (like when I had a job and only had a Windows
machine), but for the most part I was a&nbsp;TextMate&nbsp;kid.</p>
<p>After using TextMate for four years I decided it was time for another change.
Development on TextMate has stalled while TextMate Forever (err, TextMate 2) is
in the works. I started thinking about Vim (and reading blog posts by others
about how they switched back) and decided to give it&nbsp;another&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>A few months ago I bought <a href="http://amzn.com/059652983X">Learning the vi and Vim Editors</a> and went
cold-turkey with Vim as my main text editor. I haven&#8217;t looked&nbsp;back&nbsp;since.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-switched-to-textmate">Why I Switched&nbsp;to&nbsp;TextMate</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, there were a few reasons I switched to TextMate in the&nbsp;first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>First of all: it looks and acts like a real <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X application.  You can drag
files onto the icon to open them, it supports all the default <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X text
movement commands, and the chrome looks like it belongs on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X. I don&#8217;t know
if <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> was around at the time, but if it was I never&nbsp;found&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This matters. The effort required to get started with a new editor is
dramatically reduced if that editor supports all the conventions of the
operating system you use&nbsp;every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>It also has a vibrant community of people writing bundles for it, so there was
support for almost anything I wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;use.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-came-back-to-vim">Why I Came Back&nbsp;to&nbsp;Vim</h2>
<p>I came back to Vim for a number&nbsp;of&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<p>First of all: I started reading about and desiring features that didn&#8217;t seem to
be coming to TextMate any time soon. The biggest of those was split windows.
I saw the appeal of split windows right away and now that I use them I can&#8217;t
imagine not&nbsp;having&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Another reason is version control. A while ago I started keeping my
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/">dotfiles</a> in a <a href="http://hg-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> repository which makes it extremely easy to set
up new machines.  Vim keeps all of its configuration in two simple places:
a simple <code>~/.vimrc</code> file and a <code>~/.vim</code> directory full of plain&nbsp;text&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s plain text configuration files and plugins are very easy to version
control. They diff well, unlike TextMate&#8217;s multiple <code>Bundles</code> directories and
ugly <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span>&nbsp;file&nbsp;format.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s community has been around far longer than TextMate&#8217;s so there&#8217;s an even
richer set of plugins, bundles and syntax&nbsp;files&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>Another reason people give for enjoying Vim is that it runs everywhere. Yes,
it&#8217;s nice to have my favorite editor available when I <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SSH</span></span> into a machine, but
it&#8217;s not a huge deal if I don&#8217;t. I almost always edit files on my own machine
and then deploy them with an automated script of some kind, so editing on
a server is very rare&nbsp;for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h2 id="core-differences">Core&nbsp;Differences</h2>
<p>For me, Vim and TextMate are very different.  TextMate relies mainly on
keyboard shortcuts (involving Shift, Ctrl, Cmd and Alt) to do more than simply
edit text. Vim uses a &#8220;modal editing&#8221; idea to accomplish the&nbsp;same&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>TextMate&#8217;s philosophy is much the same as any normal <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X application&#8217;s, and
I said that acting like the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> reduces the barrier of entry for a text editor,
so why do I prefer&nbsp;Vim&#8217;s&nbsp;philosophy?</p>
<p>First I should prefix my answer with this: I&#8217;m not averse to a learning curve
for something as important to me as a text editor.  Yes, it&#8217;s awesome if
I don&#8217;t need to unnecessarily rewire my brain, but if it&#8217;s going to save me
a lot of time then I&#8217;m willing to cut a bit of&nbsp;slack&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>My problem with TextMate&#8217;s philosophy can be summed up in one&nbsp;word:&nbsp;&#8220;shadowing&#8221;.</p>
<p>If I want to define a new command in a bundle (or if someone else has already
done it), I&#8217;m never really sure if I&#8217;m &#8220;overwriting&#8221; some other command that my
fingers know but my brain doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;really&nbsp;register.</p>
<p>By the time I try to use the default command it could be days or weeks after
I defined the custom one, and I need to figure out what I did all over again.
It&#8217;s&nbsp;quite&nbsp;frustrating.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s &#8220;insert&#8221; mode means that when I&#8217;m editing text I&#8217;m using the normal <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span>
X text movement shortcuts that I know and love.  When I want to do something
special I enter normal mode and don&#8217;t have to worry about shadowed commands
(Vim&#8217;s leader key also helps&nbsp;with&nbsp;this).</p>
<h2 id="vims-feeling">Vim&#8217;s&nbsp;&#8220;Feeling&#8221;</h2>
<p>Vim&#8217;s normal mode has a unique &#8220;feeling&#8221; that I haven&#8217;t seen in any other text
editor (although <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">E</a> may <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/blog/2010/beyond-vi">change that</a>). I&#8217;ve heard it described in
a number of ways, and I think that while no one analogy fully explains it,
together they give a pretty&nbsp;good&nbsp;description.</p>
<h3 id="a-language-of-text-editing">A &#8220;Language&#8221; of&nbsp;Text&nbsp;Editing</h3>
<p>One way to think about Vim&#8217;s normal-mode commands is like a language.  You have
&#8220;verbs&#8221; and &#8220;nouns&#8221;.  For example: the &#8220;change&#8221; command (<code>c</code>) would be a verb
and the &#8220;word&#8221; item (<code>w</code>) is a noun.  You can combine them to form imperative
sentences that talk about what you want to do with&nbsp;your&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>The wonderful part about this is that whenever you learn a new verb (like
&#8220;delete&#8221; (<code>d</code>)) you can immediately apply it to all the nouns you know, and&nbsp;vice&nbsp;versa.</p>
<p>Vim also has &#8220;adjectives&#8221; like &#8220;inside&#8221; and &#8220;around&#8221; (<code>i</code> and <code>a</code>) that let you
craft sentences like &#8220;change inside parenthesis&#8221; (<code>ci(</code> or <code>cib</code>).  Once you
learn one of these you can immediately apply it to all the verbs and nouns you&nbsp;already&nbsp;know.</p>
<h3 id="the-physics-of-text">The Physics&nbsp;of&nbsp;Text</h3>
<p>The second way to describe the feeling of Vim is &#8220;physics&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a much less
concrete description but I think it&#8217;s&nbsp;still&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>If I throw a bowling ball into the air it behaves much the same way as if
I throw a turkey sandwich.  They might have very different effects when they
land on someone but the act of throwing them is pretty much&nbsp;the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s operators/actions/verbs act the same way. <code>daw</code> has a very different
effect than <code>da{</code> but they can both be understood with a basic underlying
principle: <code>da&lt;something&gt;</code> will &#8220;delete around <code>&lt;something&gt;</code>&#8220;.</p>
<h3 id="programming-your-editing"><span class="dquo"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span></span>Programming&#8221;&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Editing</h3>
<p>The last way that I hear people talking about Vim&#8217;s editing is: &#8220;it feels like
you&#8217;re &#8216;programming&#8217;&nbsp;your&nbsp;text&#8221;.</p>
<p>This analogy is often made by programmers (obviously) and I think it works on
more than&nbsp;one&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>First: Vim&#8217;s basic editing commands can be likened to function calls.  <code>daw</code>
can be thought of a running a function like <code>delete(type='word', around=True)</code>.
I don&#8217;t think this way (I prefer the language and physics analogies) but other&nbsp;people&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t think of the <em>basic</em> Vim commands as programming I do see
some aspects of it in other areas.  For example: say I define a leader command
in my <code>~/.vimrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="m">1</span> yypVr<span class="p">=</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I think of this as defining <code>&lt;leader&gt;1</code> to be a function that performs the&nbsp;following&nbsp;actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yank/copy the&nbsp;current&nbsp;line.</li>
<li>Paste it below (and move down to the&nbsp;pasted&nbsp;version).</li>
<li>Select the&nbsp;copied&nbsp;line.</li>
<li>Replace every character with <code>=</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another more obvious &#8220;programming&#8221; aspect of Vim is creating macros. Macros are
like tiny little functions you create to help you when you&#8217;re editing a file.
You can define them, execute them, and even edit them by pasting, editing and
yanking&nbsp;them&nbsp;back.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting&nbsp;Started</h2>
<p>When I switched back to Vim I did a few things that helped make my&nbsp;transition&nbsp;stick.</p>
<p>First: I bought <a href="http://amzn.com/059652983X">Learning the vi and Vim Editors</a> and read it cover to cover.
It helps quite a bit to know the history behind Vim, and the book also teaches
you the basics of Vim&#8217;s&nbsp;editing&nbsp;commands.</p>
<p>I also looked through <a href="http://reddit.com/r/vim/">the Vim subreddit</a> to find some good blog posts about
switching.  A lot of people have written about it and it was very helpful to
read about&nbsp;their&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>And finally, the most important part: I switched cold-turkey.  Vim runs everywhere, so
there&#8217;s really no excuse for not doing this.  Every decent <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> has a version of
Vim that makes insert mode &#8220;just work&#8221; for their <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> (like gvim or MacVim), so
the barrier to entry these days is&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;low.</p>
<p>You can get Vim and start using it right away by staying in insert mode most of
the time. Then you can start learning its real features at your own pace.
Trying to use two different editors at once just slows down the learning
process and makes you less productive&nbsp;in&nbsp;both.</p>
<h2 id="making-vim-more-useful">Making Vim&nbsp;More&nbsp;Useful</h2>
<p>One of the flaws of Vim is that it takes quite a bit of configuration to make
it behave in a decent way. The defaults are backwards-compatible with vi (i.e.
older than most college students) and not&nbsp;very&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things I do to make Vim a bit&nbsp;more&nbsp;palatable.</p>
<p><strong>A quick side note:</strong> even if you don&#8217;t use Vim, you <em>need</em> to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RemapCapsLock">remap your
capslock key</a> to something useful.  Just do it, you&#8217;ll&nbsp;thank&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t go through every line in <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/.vimrc">my <code>~/.vimrc</code> file</a>, but here are some of the
lines that I simply could not&nbsp;live&nbsp;without.</p>
<p>First, a few lines that you absolutely&nbsp;must&nbsp;have:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">filetype</span> off
<span class="k">call</span> pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">filetype</span> plugin indent <span class="k">on</span>

<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">nocompatible</span>

<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">modelines</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>filetype</code> and <code>call</code> lines are for loading Pathogen, which is described in
the bundles section. See <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332">Pathogen&#8217;s docs</a> to learn about why the
first <code>filetype</code> line&nbsp;is&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><code>set nocompatible</code> gets rid of all the crap that Vim does to be vi compatible.
It&#8217;s 2010 &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to be compatible with vi at the expense of
functionality&nbsp;any&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The <code>modelines</code> bit prevents some <a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-vim-maintainers/2007-June/004020.html">security exploits</a> having to do with
modelines in files.  I never use modelines so I don&#8217;t miss any&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Next I set my&nbsp;tab&nbsp;settings:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">tabstop</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">4</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">shiftwidth</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">4</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">softtabstop</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">4</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">expandtab</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I like all tabs to expand to four spaces.  Check out <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/tabs-and-spaces/">this Vimcast</a> to
learn more about each of&nbsp;these&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>Next are a few options that just make&nbsp;things&nbsp;better:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">encoding</span><span class="p">=</span>utf<span class="m">-8</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">scrolloff</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">3</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">autoindent</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">showmode</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">showcmd</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">hidden</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">wildmenu</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">wildmode</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="nb">list</span>:longest
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">visualbell</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">cursorline</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">ttyfast</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">ruler</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">backspace</span><span class="p">=</span>indent<span class="p">,</span><span class="nb">eol</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">start</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">laststatus</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">2</span>
<span class="k">set</span> relativenumber
<span class="k">set</span> undofile
</pre></div>


<p>Each of these lines are basically to make Vim behave in a sane manner.  The two
&#8220;interesting&#8221; ones are the last two, and both deal with features that are
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim_announce/browse_thread/thread/66c02efd1523554b">new in Vim 7.3</a>.</p>
<p><code>relativenumber</code> changes Vim&#8217;s line number column to display how far away each
line is from the current one, instead of showing the absolute&nbsp;line&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>I almost never care what numeric line I&#8217;m on in a file (and if I do I can see
it in the status line), so I don&#8217;t miss the normal line numbers. I <em>do</em> care
how far away a particular line might be, because it tells me what number I need
to use with motion commands like <code>d&lt;NUMBER&gt;d</code>.</p>
<p><code>undofile</code> tells Vim to create <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;.un~</code> files whenever you edit a file.
These files contain undo information so you can undo previous actions even
after you close and reopen&nbsp;a&nbsp;file.</p>
<p>Next I change the <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> key:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">let</span> mapleader <span class="p">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;,&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For me <code>,</code> is easier to type than <code>\</code>. I use leader commands constantly so it&#8217;s&nbsp;worth&nbsp;changing.</p>
<p>The next thing I do is&nbsp;tame&nbsp;searching/moving:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="sr">/ /</span>\v
vnoremap <span class="sr">/ /</span>\v
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">ignorecase</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">smartcase</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">gdefault</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">incsearch</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">showmatch</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">hlsearch</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span>space<span class="p">&gt;</span> :<span class="k">noh</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">tab</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> %
vnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">tab</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> %
</pre></div>


<p>The first two lines fix Vim&#8217;s horribly broken default regex &#8220;handling&#8221; by
automatically inserting a <code>\v</code> before any string you search for.  This turns
off Vim&#8217;s crazy default regex characters and makes searches use normal regexes.
I already know Perl/Python compatible regex formatting, why would I want to
learn&nbsp;another&nbsp;scheme?</p>
<p><code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> together make Vim deal with case-sensitive search
intelligently. If you search for an all-lowercase string your search will be
case-insensitive, but if one or more characters is uppercase the search will be
case-sensitive. Most of the time this does what&nbsp;you&nbsp;want.</p>
<p><code>gdefault</code> applies substitutions globally on lines.  For example, instead of
<code>:%s/foo/bar/g</code> you just type <code>:%s/foo/bar/</code>.  This is almost always what you
want (when was the last time you wanted to only replace the first occurrence of
a word on a line?) and if you need the previous behavior you just tack on the
<code>g</code> again.</p>
<p><code>incsearch</code>, <code>showmatch</code> and <code>hlsearch</code> work together to highlight search
results (as you type).  It&#8217;s really quite handy, as long as you have the next
line&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;space&gt;</code> mapping makes it easy to clear out a search by typing
<code>,&lt;space&gt;</code>. This gets rid of the distracting highlighting once I&#8217;ve found what
I&#8217;m&nbsp;looking&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>The last two lines make the tab key match bracket pairs. I use this to move
around all the time and <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> is a hell of a lot easier to type than <code>%</code>.</p>
<p>The next section makes Vim handle long&nbsp;lines&nbsp;correctly:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">wrap</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">textwidth</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">79</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">formatoptions</span><span class="p">=</span>qrn1
<span class="k">set</span> colorcolumn<span class="p">=</span><span class="m">85</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These lines manage my line wrapping settings and also show a colored column at
85 characters (so I can see when I write a too-long line&nbsp;of&nbsp;code).</p>
<p>See <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#fo-table"><code>:help fo-table</code></a> and the Vimcasts on <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/soft-wrapping-text/">soft wrapping</a> and <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/hard-wrapping-text/">hard wrapping</a> for&nbsp;more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Next comes something other TextMate refugees&nbsp;may&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">list</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">listchars</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="k">tab</span>:▸\ <span class="p">,</span><span class="nb">eol</span>:¬
</pre></div>


<p>This makes Vim show invisible characters with the same characters that TextMate
uses.  You might need to adjust your color scheme so they&#8217;re not too
distracting. <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/show-invisibles/">This Vimcast</a> has&nbsp;more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>New Vim users will want the following lines to teach them to do&nbsp;things&nbsp;right:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">up</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>down<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">left</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">right</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">up</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>down<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">left</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">right</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="k">j</span> gj
nnoremap <span class="k">k</span> gk
</pre></div>


<p>This will disable the arrow keys while you&#8217;re in normal mode to help you learn
to use <code>hjkl</code>.  Trust me, you want to learn to use <code>hjkl</code>.  Playing a lot of
<a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a>&nbsp;also&nbsp;helps.</p>
<p>It also disables the arrow keys in insert mode to force you to get back into
normal mode the instant you&#8217;re done inserting text, which is the &#8220;right way&#8221; to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>It also makes j and k work the way you expect instead of working in some
archaic &#8220;movement by file line instead of screen&nbsp;line&#8221;&nbsp;fashion.</p>
<p>Next, get rid of that stupid goddamned help key that you will invaribly hit
<em>constantly</em> while aiming&nbsp;for&nbsp;escape:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>F1<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ESC</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>F1<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ESC</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
vnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>F1<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ESC</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I also like to make <code>;</code> do the same thing as <code>:</code> &#8212; it&#8217;s one less key to hit
every time I want to save&nbsp;a&nbsp;file:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap ; :
</pre></div>


<p>I don&#8217;t remap <code>:</code> back to <code>;</code> because it seems to break a bunch&nbsp;of&nbsp;plugins.</p>
<p>Finally, I really like TextMate&#8217;s &#8220;save on losing focus&#8221; feature.  I can&#8217;t
remember a time when I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want to save a file after tabbing away from my
editor (especially with version control and Vim&#8217;s&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;undo):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>au <span class="nb">FocusLost</span> * :<span class="k">wa</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Those are the most important bits of my <code>~/.vimrc</code> file. Next I&#8217;ll talk about
the wonderful namespace of customization that is Vim&#8217;s <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> key.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-leader">Using&nbsp;the&nbsp;Leader</h3>
<p>Vim dedicates an entire keyboard key for user-specific customizations. This is
called the &#8220;leader&#8221; and by default it&#8217;s mapped to <code>\</code>. As I mentioned in the
previous section I prefer to use <code>,</code> instead.</p>
<p>Each person will find little things they type or execute often and want to
create shortcuts for those things. The leader is a kind of &#8220;namespace&#8221; to keep
those customizations separate and prevent them from shadowing&nbsp;default&nbsp;commands.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things I use leader commands for.  You&#8217;ll certainly have
different ideas than I do, but this might give you an idea of what you&nbsp;can&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>I use <code>,W</code> to mean &#8220;strip all trailing whitespace in the current file&#8221; so I can
clean things&nbsp;up&nbsp;quickly:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>W :%s<span class="sr">/\s\+$//&lt;cr&gt;:let @/</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CR</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I use Ack a lot (described below), so I mapped a leader key&nbsp;for&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>a :Ack
</pre></div>


<p>I work with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> often, so I have <code>,ft</code> mapped to a &#8220;fold&nbsp;tag&#8221;&nbsp;function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="nb">ft</span> Vatzf
</pre></div>


<p>I also work with Nick Sergeant and he likes his <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span> properties sorted, so
here&#8217;s a <code>,S</code> mapping that sorts them&nbsp;for&nbsp;me:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>S ?{<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CR</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>jV/^\s*\}?$<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CR</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">k</span>:<span class="k">sort</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CR</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>:<span class="k">noh</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CR</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This next mapping imitates TextMates <code>Ctrl+Q</code> function to re-hardwrap
paragraphs&nbsp;of&nbsp;text:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">q</span> gqip
</pre></div>


<p>I have a <code>,v</code> mapping to reselect the text that was just pasted so I can
perform commands (like indentation)&nbsp;on&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>v V`]
</pre></div>


<p>This last mapping lets me quickly open up my <code>~/.vimrc</code> file in a vertically
split window so I can add new things to it on&nbsp;the&nbsp;fly.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>ev <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span>v<span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">l</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>:<span class="k">e</span> $<span class="caps"><span class="caps">MYVIMRC</span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3 id="quicker-escaping">Quicker&nbsp;Escaping</h3>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll find yourself constantly doing in Vim is moving from insert
mode to normal mode.  The default way to do this is by hitting Escape, but that
key is out of the way and hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;hit.</p>
<p>Another way is to use <code>Ctrl+C</code> or <code>Ctrl+[</code>, but I don&#8217;t like using a chord for
something I press&nbsp;that&nbsp;often.</p>
<p>I personally use <code>jj</code> to exit back to normal mode. The only time I&#8217;ve ever
actually tried to hit two <code>j</code>&#8216;s in a row is just now while writing this entry,
so it doesn&#8217;t conflict with my normal typing&nbsp;at&nbsp;all:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>inoremap jj <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ESC</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3 id="working-with-split-windows">Working With&nbsp;Split&nbsp;Windows</h3>
<p>Being able to split my editor window and see more than one file at once is one
of the main reasons I switched to Vim.  I know I&#8217;m not alone here after reading
various posts around the internet asking for this feature&nbsp;in&nbsp;TextMate.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s default commands for interacting with splits, however, are kind of
clunky.  I&#8217;ve added a few mappings to my <code>~/.vimrc</code> that make things work a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;smoother.</p>
<p>This first mapping makes <code>,w</code> open a new vertical split and switch over to it.
Because really, how often do you split your window and not want to do something
in the&nbsp;new&nbsp;split?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">w</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>v<span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">l</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might notice that this mapping is for vertical splits.  I almost <em>never</em>
use horizontal splits. All of my screens are widescreen, so I can fit several
files onscreen if they&#8217;re split vertically. Horizontal splits don&#8217;t let me see
enough of the file. If I <em>really</em> want a horizontal split I can use <code>&lt;C-w&gt;s</code>
to&nbsp;get&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>This next set of mappings maps <code>&lt;C-[h/j/k/l]&gt;</code> to the commands needed to move
around your splits.  If you remap your capslock key to <code>Ctrl</code> it makes for very&nbsp;easy&nbsp;navigation.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">h</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">h</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">j</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">j</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">k</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">k</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">l</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">l</span>
</pre></div>


<h2 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h2>
<p>I know some people say: &#8220;looks don&#8217;t matter, the only thing that&#8217;s important is
functionality&#8221;. That&#8217;s&nbsp;completely&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m looking at something for multiple hours each day it had damn well better
look pretty. There are three main steps to making Vim look pretty (for me, on
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X &#8212; your mileage&nbsp;may&nbsp;vary).</p>
<p>First: get <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>.  It makes Vim look (and behave) like a native Mac
application. It helps it avoid standing out like a sore thumb among your other
applications. Linux and Windows users will probably&nbsp;want&nbsp;gvim.</p>
<p>Next: pick a decent font.  I prefer 12 point <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/06/font-changes-coming-to-mac-os-x-snow-leopard.ars">Menlo</a>.  You might have
a different preference, but at least try out a few and find one that has a nice
balance between line height (so you can get a good amount of lines on the
screen) and readability (slashed&nbsp;zeros,&nbsp;please).</p>
<p>Finally: find a good color scheme. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/colors/molokai.vim">a slightly modified
version</a> of <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2340">Molokai</a> (a port of the TextMate <a href="http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/">Monokai</a> theme)
since I came back to Vim, but recently I&#8217;ve also started flirting with
<a href="http://hcalves.deviantart.com/art/Mustang-Vim-Colorscheme-98974484">Mustang</a> and <a href="http://forr.st/~yZn">Clouds Midnight</a>.  Spend an hour and find something that
looks good&nbsp;to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what my current setup&nbsp;looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<p><img alt="Current Vim Setup Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2010/09/vim.png" title="My Current Vim Setup" /></p>
<h2 id="bundles-i-use">Bundles&nbsp;I&nbsp;Use</h2>
<p>Vim has been around for a <em>long</em> time, and many people have written extensions
for it.  Here are a few of the bundles I couldn&#8217;t live without in my&nbsp;day-to-day&nbsp;editing.</p>
<h3 id="pathogen">Pathogen</h3>
<p>First of all: <a href="http://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope</a> has created the wonderful <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> plugin that
makes managing <em>other</em> Vim plugins painless.  Instead of scattering their files
throughout your <code>~/.vim/</code> folder you can keep their files inside a single
folder in <code>~/.vim/bundles/</code>.</p>
<p>Install it and keep&nbsp;your&nbsp;sanity.</p>
<h3 id="peepopen">PeepOpen</h3>
<p>One of TextMate&#8217;s &#8220;killer features&#8221; is its <code>Cmd+T</code> key. It lets you open files
quickly by typing fragments of&nbsp;their&nbsp;names.</p>
<p>There are a number of Vim plugins out there that try to emulate it.  My
favorite is <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen">PeepOpen</a>.  Yes, it&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X only and costs money, but it&#8217;s worth
it.  It looks good and&nbsp;&#8220;just&nbsp;works&#8221;.</p>
<p>PeepOpen has some nifty little features, like showing Git metadata in the file
list. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://github.com/topfunky/PeepOpen-Issues/issues#issue/91">offered a patch</a> to add the same functionality for Mercurial but
haven&#8217;t heard back from&nbsp;the&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X (or want a free alternative to PeepOpen) I hear the
<a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">Command-T</a> plugin is&nbsp;quite&nbsp;nice.</p>
<h3 id="nerdtree">NERDTree</h3>
<p>One plugin you&#8217;ll hear about in almost all of these &#8220;switching to Vim&#8221; blog
posts is <a href="http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>. It&#8217;s a little plugin for browsing files in your project,
and it works great. There&#8217;s no better &#8220;TextMate file-drawer&#8221;&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;around.</p>
<h3 id="nerdcommenter">NERDCommenter</h3>
<p>Want to be able to comment and uncomment code with a few keypresses?  You need
<a href="http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter">NERDCommenter</a>. It&#8217;s surprising that Vim doesn&#8217;t have decent commenting
functionality built in, but NERDCommenter&nbsp;fixes&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I really only use this plugin for one single function: &#8220;toggle comment&#8221; with
<code>&lt;leader&gt;c&lt;space&gt;</code>. That function alone is worth&nbsp;installing&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="ack">Ack</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a programmer and you don&#8217;t know about <a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">Ack</a>, you need to start
using it now. It&#8217;s far, far better&nbsp;than&nbsp;grep.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">Ack plugin</a> for Vim integrates Ack with Vim&#8217;s quickfix window so
you can easily search and jump&nbsp;to&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the section about leader mappings I&#8217;ve got <code>,a</code> mapped to
bring up Ack all ready&nbsp;to&nbsp;search.</p>
<h3 id="snipmate">Snipmate</h3>
<p>Another feature of TextMate that was <em>amazing</em> when I first saw it was
snippets. <a href="http://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim">SnipMate</a> is a Vim plugin that emulates&nbsp;TextMate&nbsp;snippets.</p>
<p>It also stores them in easily-version-controlled plain text files, which is
a bonus over&nbsp;TextMate&#8217;s&nbsp;snippets.</p>
<h3 id="sparkup">Sparkup</h3>
<p><a href="http://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup">Sparkup</a> is pretty much a great port of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/">Zen Coding</a> for Vim. If you write
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> at all this plugin will save you a ton&nbsp;of&nbsp;typing.</p>
<p>In a nutshell it lets you type&nbsp;something&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>div.content&gt;h1.post-title+p{Sample Content}
</pre></div>


<p>Press <code>Cmd+E</code> and it will expand&nbsp;to&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;post-title&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sample Content<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It&#8217;s far less typing and it adds up&nbsp;over&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3 id="yankring">Yankring</h3>
<p>Vim&#8217;s copying and pasting functionality (which uses registers) is very, very
powerful, but it&#8217;s not exactly &#8220;user friendly&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1234">YankRing</a> plugin adds
a lot <em>more</em> power, but also adds a few features that make copying and pasting
much&nbsp;more&nbsp;pleasant.</p>
<p>For example, after you paste some text you can replace that paste with the
previous item you copied with <code>Ctrl-P</code>.  You can cycle back further by just
hitting <code>Ctrl-P</code> over&nbsp;and&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>YankRing also shares your yanked text between Vim windows, which makes things
&#8220;just work&#8221; when you want to paste text from one window&nbsp;into&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>You can also show a list of all your previously yanked text with <code>:YRShow</code>.
Mapping that command to a key is&nbsp;quite&nbsp;helpful:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">silent</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>F3<span class="p">&gt;</span> :YRShow<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
inoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">silent</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>F3<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ESC</span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span>:YRShow<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>YankRing offers a ton of other cool functionality but I haven&#8217;t had the time or
motivation to really dig in and find out how to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="surround-and-repeat">Surround&nbsp;(and&nbsp;Repeat)</h3>
<p>Another of Time Pope&#8217;s plugins that I use all the time is the <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">Surround</a>
plugin.  It adds another layer to Vim&#8217;s physics:&nbsp;&#8220;surrounding&nbsp;items&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, you can &#8220;change surrounding single quotes to double quotes&#8221; by
using <code>cs'"</code>. Or if you&#8217;re writing something in Markdown and want to italicize
a word you can use <code>ysiW*</code>.</p>
<p>All the nouns and verbs you already know can be used, which fits with Vim&#8217;s
philosophy and makes it&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;powerful.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat">Repeat</a> plugin is necessary to make these surround actions repeatable
with <code>.</code>.</p>
<h3 id="slime">Slime</h3>
<p>Emacs users often tout <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLIME</span></span> as one of Emacs&#8217; &#8220;killer features&#8221;. When writing
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">LISP</span></span> code it&#8217;s&nbsp;unchallengably&nbsp;awesome.</p>
<p>Vim doesn&#8217;t have anything like <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLIME</span></span>. It&#8217;s not integrated with any language the
way Emacs is coupled to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LISP</span></span>. You can, however, achieve <em>some</em> of the power of
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">SLIME</span></span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Vim.</p>
<p><a href="http://technotales.wordpress.com/">Jonathan Palardy</a> has written a little Vim plugin called <a href="http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/">Slime.vim</a> that
lets Vim easily communicate with a screen session, probably one running a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">REPL</span></span>
for some language like <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LISP</span></span>, Python&nbsp;or&nbsp;Ruby.</p>
<p>The general idea is that you&#8217;ll fire up <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LISP</span></span> in a screen session, then go over
to Vim and use <code>Ctrl+C Ctrl+C</code> to put chunks of code in your Vim window into
the&nbsp;screen&nbsp;session.</p>
<p>It works and is quite handy for when you want to experiment with the contents
of a file. Add a mapping for shoving over the entire file and you&#8217;re all set to
bash out and test some&nbsp;code&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/plugin/slime.vim">a slightly modified version</a> that removes a bit of
the flexibility I don&#8217;t need to make it quicker to use. Maybe some day I&#8217;ll
expand on it and push it up to BitBucket and GitHub in a repo of&nbsp;its&nbsp;own.</p>
<h3 id="scratch">Scratch</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=664">Scratch</a> plugin adds a function to quickly open a &#8220;scratch&#8221; buffer that
will never&nbsp;be&nbsp;saved.</p>
<p>I have it mapped to <code>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</code> and use it with slime to quickly stick
a bit of code that I don&#8217;t want in my actual file into the&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">REPL</span></span>.</p>
<h3 id="rainbow-parentheses">Rainbow&nbsp;Parentheses</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561">Rainbow Parentheses</a> is a Vim plugin that colorizes parentheses, square
brackets, curly brackets and angle brackets according to&nbsp;their&nbsp;nesting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easiest to describe what this looks like with&nbsp;a&nbsp;screenshot:</p>
<p><img alt="Rainbow Parentheses Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2010/09/rainbow.png" title="Rainbow Parentheses" /></p>
<p>I use <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/bundle/rainbow/">a slightly modified version</a>. I have it mapped to <code>&lt;leader&gt;R</code>
and off by default.  When I&#8217;m dealing with a particularly hairy piece of code
that has lots of nesting I simply hit <code>&lt;leader&gt;R</code> and get some color that helps
me keep&nbsp;my&nbsp;place.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-want">Things&nbsp;I&nbsp;Want</h2>
<p>Although Vim is definitely my new favorite editor, this blog post wouldn&#8217;t be
complete without a&nbsp;few&nbsp;complaints.</p>
<p>If anyone fixes/implements any of these I&#8217;ll gladly buy them&nbsp;several&nbsp;beers.</p>
<h3 id="html-indentation-that-doesnt-suck"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> Indentation that&nbsp;Doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;Suck</h3>
<p>I write a lot of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>. One thing that annoys the hell out of me is Vim&#8217;s
&#8220;smart&#8221; indenting of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>. I&#8217;ve tried every combination of <code>cindent</code>,
<code>smartindent</code> and <code>autoindent</code> and I can&#8217;t seem to get Vim to&nbsp;behave&nbsp;sanely.</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes when I press return after a tag that I&#8217;ve already
created Vim will unindent the new line <em>and the previous line</em>. This is&nbsp;excruciatingly&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<p>All I want is&nbsp;the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I press return, create a new line at the same indentation level as the
  current one. Don&#8217;t try to be clever and adjust the indent of new line in&nbsp;any&nbsp;fashion.</li>
<li>If I press tab at the beginning of a line, indent the <em>current line</em> by&nbsp;one&nbsp;tabstop.</li>
<li>If I press backspace at the beginning of a line, delete one tabstop on that&nbsp;line&nbsp;only.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, someone make this happen and restore&nbsp;my&nbsp;sanity.</p>
<h3 id="python-support-for-slime">Python Support&nbsp;for&nbsp;Slime</h3>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that I use the slime plugin. One language it doesn&#8217;t work
very well with is Python, because it preserves whitespace when it moves the
code over the&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">REPL</span></span>.</p>
<p>This is a problem with Python because if you try to move over an indented block
of code you&#8217;ll get &#8220;unexpected&nbsp;indent&#8221;&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love for someone to tweak slime so it intelligently unindents Python code.
I have some ideas on how this could work but unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the
time to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;them.</p>
<h3 id="gundo">Gundo</h3>
<p>A little-known fact about Vim is that it doesn&#8217;t keep a list of your undo
history, it keeps a <em>tree</em>.</p>
<p>If I make 5 changes, undo 2 and then make 2 more Vim keeps track of <em>all</em> of
them. You can use <code>:undolist</code> to see the list of leaves in this&nbsp;&#8220;undo&nbsp;tree&#8221;.</p>
<p>What I want is for someone to make an awesome &#8220;graphical undo&#8221; plugin that
shows a graph of the undo tree, much like Mercurial&#8217;s graphlog extension shows
a graph of the changesets in&nbsp;a&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>This graph would actually be simpler than Mercurial&#8217;s graphlog because there
are no merges to&nbsp;deal&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>For bonus points let me browse the tree with <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>, press <code>p</code> to preview
a diff of what would happen if I went back to that version, and press <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> to
actually&nbsp;go&nbsp;back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>:</strong> I got tired of waiting, so I <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sjl/gundo.vim/">wrote it myself</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-mercurial-version-of-fugitive">A Mercurial Version&nbsp;of&nbsp;Fugitive</h3>
<p>The final thing I&#8217;d like is for someone to make a Mercurial plugin for Vim that
is as awesome as Tim Pope&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some Mercurial support for Vim out there, but for the most part it&#8217;s
tied up in plugins that support multiple version&nbsp;control&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>Any plugin that tries to support every system will fail at supporting one
single system perfectly, so I&#8217;d love for someone to come along and make an
<em>awesome</em> Vim plugin that lets you use Mercurial to its fullest while&nbsp;inside&nbsp;Vim.</p>
<p>I simply don&#8217;t know vimscript well enough to do this on my own, but if someone
else is interested I can certainly help out on the Mercurial and user&nbsp;interface&nbsp;aspects.</p>
<h2 id="overall-thoughts">Overall&nbsp;Thoughts</h2>
<p>Transitioning back to Vim after using TextMate for a few years wasn&#8217;t trivial,
but I feel that it was worth the effort.  I have features like split windows
now and there are plugins that can provide anything I miss&nbsp;from&nbsp;TextMate.</p>
<p>If TextMate 2 ever gets released it would have to do some pretty amazing things
for me to want to&nbsp;switch&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;m very happy with Vim.  There are a lot of things that could be
improved, especially with the default settings (who cares about vi
compatibility in 2010?), but a text editor is worth a&nbsp;learning&nbsp;curve.</p>
<p>In my eyes Vim has two huge advantages over almost any other editor out there.
The first is it&#8217;s <em>huge</em> ecosystem of plugins and syntax definitions, which is
only rivaled by Emacs (and <em>possibly</em> TextMate, though I doubt it). The second
is it&#8217;s &#8220;modal editing&#8221; philosophy, which is extremely powerful and hasn&#8217;t been
adopted by any other mainstream editor (except for <em>very</em> recent versions&nbsp;of&nbsp;E).</p>
