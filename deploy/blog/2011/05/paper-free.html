                    <p>It&#8217;s 2011. Personal computers have been around and popular for well over a decade
now, and yet we still have to deal with a huge amount of&nbsp;physical&nbsp;paper.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to go paper-free for a long time now. The advantages&nbsp;are&nbsp;obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper takes up physical space in our homes that digital&nbsp;files&nbsp;don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Digital files, if properly encrypted, are far more secure than sheets of paper that
  could&nbsp;be&nbsp;stolen.</li>
<li>Digital files can be searched in an instant, while papers have to be laboriously&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;through.</li>
<li>Digital files can be backed up perfectly&nbsp;and&nbsp;easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading <a href="http://ryanwaggoner.com/2010/11/how-i-filled-two-dumpsters-and-went-paperless-with-the-fujitsu-scansnap-s1500/">this article</a> I was psyched to scan and shred all the boxes of paper
sitting in my apartment, but the $420+ price tag was hard to swallow. I started
looking around for&nbsp;other&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements I have for any&nbsp;paper-free&nbsp;system:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scanned files need to be <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed so I can search them easily. I&#8217;m too lazy to
  categorize and tag&nbsp;files&nbsp;manually.</li>
<li>I need to be able to scan files anywhere.  If I&#8217;m out at dinner I want to be able
  to snap a picture of my receipt and tear it up&nbsp;right&nbsp;there.</li>
<li>No &#8220;cloud&#8221; services allowed for unencrypted important documents. I simply don&#8217;t
  trust Google/Dropbox/etc enough to put my bank statements and&nbsp;such&nbsp;there.</li>
<li>Files need to be backed up securely in case my apartment&nbsp;burns&nbsp;down.</li>
<li>The entire process needs to be automated as much as possible, otherwise I&#8217;ll get
  lazy and not&nbsp;scan&nbsp;things.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me a while, but I&#8217;ve finally got a system I&#8217;m happy with. This post will
describe each part and how they fit together. The total cost is about $220, $160 of
which is for a&nbsp;physical&nbsp;scanner.</p>
<p>Note: I use <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OS</span></span> X and an iPhone, so this post will focus on that platform. However,
the important pieces of software will run on Windows and I&#8217;m sure there are
Windows/Android equivalents to the&nbsp;other&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<h2 id="scanning-at-home">Scanning&nbsp;at&nbsp;Home</h2>
<p>The first step to becoming paper-free is obviously scanning your documents.  There
are a lot of scanners out there, some more expensive than others. I eventually
settled on a <a href="http://www.getdoxie.com/">Doxie</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;$160.</p>
<p>I chose the&nbsp;Doxie&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s&nbsp;compact.</li>
<li>It runs with a single <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span>&nbsp;cable.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s&nbsp;cross-platform.</li>
<li>Its software has a great, polished&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">UI</span></span>.</li>
<li>It has a &#8220;multiple-function button&#8221; that lets you control it without&nbsp;the&nbsp;mouse/keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first, second, and last points mean that (with a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> extension cable) I can scan
documents while sitting on the couch and watching Netflix, which is critical for lazy
people&nbsp;like&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I set Doxie to save scans on my Desktop. The scanning process is pretty simple so
I won&#8217;t describe it here. Check out Doxie&#8217;s documentation for&nbsp;more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When I first received my Doxie and tried to calibrate it, it simply made
a grinding noise and wouldn&#8217;t feed the paper.  I emailed their tech support and
within half an hour I got a response back saying they were shipping me a&nbsp;replacement&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>When I got the replacement it worked like a charm.  Their customer service was so
great that I&#8217;d still recommend the Doxie even though my first one was&nbsp;a&nbsp;dud.</p>
<h2 id="scanning-on-the-go">Scanning on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Go</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, I want to be able to scan things while out and about with my
iPhone. There are a bunch of iPhone document-scanning apps out there. I settled on
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jotnot-scanner-pro/id307868751?mt=8">JotNot</a> for $7 because it has a decent <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UI</span></span> and supports&nbsp;multiple-page&nbsp;PDFs.</p>
<p>JotNot&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UI</span></span> is pretty easy to get the hang of so I won&#8217;t go over&nbsp;it&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Once I finish scanning something I send the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> to a <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> folder&nbsp;called&nbsp;&#8220;JotNot&#8221;. </p>
<p>I know I said in my requirements that &#8220;cloud&#8221; services weren&#8217;t allowed, but I make an
exception for non-critical things that I&#8217;d be scanning with my phone. I don&#8217;t care if
Dropbox knows how much I spent&nbsp;on&nbsp;dinner.</p>
<h2 id="ocring-scanned-documents"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ing&nbsp;Scanned&nbsp;Documents</h2>
<p>The next step is to run the scanned PDFs through an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> program so they can be
searched&nbsp;with&nbsp;Spotlight.</p>
<p>I looked at a lot of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> software and finally settled on <a href="http://solutions.weblite.ca/pdfocrx/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> X</a> for $30. It
has a simple interface, does a pretty good job at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ing, has a free version so
I could try it out, and&nbsp;is&nbsp;cross-platform.</p>
<p>Using it is simple: you drag a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> onto the app and select your desired settings
(make sure to choose &#8220;searchable <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span>&#8221; as the output format). The app will think for
a while and then create a new <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> next to the old one with the searchable&nbsp;text&nbsp;embedded.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done this once you should go into the preferences and change it to
non-interactive mode so that it won&#8217;t prompt you for the settings every time you&nbsp;use&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="gluing-everything-together">Gluing&nbsp;Everything&nbsp;Together</h2>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve got two folders with scanned PDFs and a method for <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ing them. The
next step is to automate&nbsp;the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>I use an app called <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to do this. It&#8217;s $21 for a license and well worth it.
We&#8217;ll set up four rules to make our&nbsp;lives&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>Before we start we need to create two folders somewhere (you can name them whatever&nbsp;you&nbsp;like):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pending <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>: A folder to hold documents that are waiting to be&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed.</li>
<li>Dead Trees: A folder to hold the final, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed versions of&nbsp;our&nbsp;documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first rule watches the Desktop for scans from Doxie.  Any files placed on the
Desktop whose name starts with &#8220;Doxie Doc&#8221; will be renamed to include the current
date and time, and then moved to the &#8220;Pending <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8221;&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p><img alt="Rule 1 Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2011/05/rules-1-doxie.png" title="Rule 1" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>: you&#8217;ll need to click the <code>date created</code> bubble and then &#8220;Edit Date&#8221; to get
the time as well as the date into&nbsp;the&nbsp;filename.</p>
<p>The second rule watches the &#8220;JotNot&#8221; folder for scans from the iPhone app.  Any PDFs
that appear in here (i.e. that are synced down from Dropbox) will be moved to the
&#8220;Pending <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8221; folder.  We don&#8217;t need to rename them like we did with the Doxie scans
because JotNot already includes the date and time of scans in the filenames&nbsp;by&nbsp;default.</p>
<p><img alt="Rule 2 Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2011/05/rules-2-jotnot.png" title="Rule 2" /></p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got all of our scans going into the same folder (with unique names) we
can set up a rule to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> them.  The third rule watches the &#8220;Pending <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8221; folder for
PDFs.  When a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> lands in the folder it will be moved to its final destination
folder (&#8220;Dead Trees&#8221; in my case) and then opened in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> X.  Because I&#8217;ve put <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span>
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span> X in non-interactive mode the files will automatically be <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed without any
intervention&nbsp;from&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><img alt="Rule 3 Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2011/05/rules-3-ocr.png" title="Rule 3" /></p>
<p>The fourth and final rule watches for the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed copies of our scans and runs
a script to move the originals to the trash once the searchable versions are ready.
It doesn&#8217;t delete the files completely because I want a safety net in case something&nbsp;goes&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="Rule 4 Screenshot" src="/media/images/blog/2011/05/rules-4-clean.png" title="Rule 4" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you change the Shell to <code>/usr/bin/python</code>.  Here&#8217;s the text of
the script so you can copy and&nbsp;paste&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">import</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">os</span>

<span class="n">RM_CMD</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;&quot;osascript -e &#39;tell app &quot;</span><span class="n">Finder</span><span class="s">&quot; to move the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">POSIX</span></span> file &quot;</span><span class="nv">%s</span><span class="s">&quot; to trash&#39;&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="n">old_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rsplit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">old_file</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RM_CMD</span> <span class="nv">%</span> <span class="nv">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abspath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">old_file</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once these four rules are in place we can simply scan a document with Doxie or JotNot
and it will automatically be <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&#8217;ed and placed in our &#8220;Dead Trees&#8221; folder, with no
intervention&nbsp;from&nbsp;us!</p>
<h2 id="backing-up">Backing&nbsp;Up</h2>
<p>A while ago I was using Mozy for full backups. Recently they changed their pricing so
it was no longer unlimited. When that happened I switched to <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
couldn&#8217;t&nbsp;be&nbsp;happier.</p>
<p>Backblaze&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UI</span></span> is leaps and bounds above Mozy&#8217;s, and they offer an option to generate
a secure encryption key for encrypting your backups. I highly recommend this, but be
sure to have a few copies of your key because you&#8217;ll need it to restore&nbsp;your&nbsp;backups.</p>
<p>Backblaze is also only $5 per month (less if you pay for a year in advance) for
unlimited backups which is definitely a bargain.  As a bonus, they just released
a <a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/2011/05/23/lost-your-computer-get-it-back-backblaze-launches-locate-my-computer/">&#8220;find my computer&#8221; feature</a> that&#8217;s kind of like a lightweight
version of <a href="http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/">Undercover</a>, so it&#8217;s an even&nbsp;better&nbsp;deal.</p>
<h2 id="destroying-the-originals">Destroying&nbsp;the&nbsp;Originals</h2>
<p>Once the documents are scanned and backed up it&#8217;s time to destroy the physical paper.
If you live in a rural area you could burn them&nbsp;for&nbsp;free.</p>
<p>Those of us that can&#8217;t start random fires need a paper shredder. I use a shredder
I picked up a long time ago &#8212; any crosscut shredder will do&nbsp;the&nbsp;job.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>After all of this I&#8217;ve now got a mostly-automated system that lets me go paper-free.
The&nbsp;costs&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doxie&nbsp;Scanner:&nbsp;$160</li>
<li>JotNot:&nbsp;$7</li>
<li><span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OCR</span></span>&nbsp;X:&nbsp;$30</li>
<li>Hazel:&nbsp;$21</li>
<li>Backblaze: $5&nbsp;per&nbsp;month</li>
</ul>
<p>For me the $218 initial cost is worth it.  Now I can search all of my paper in
a instant and my apartment is much less cluttered. If you have the money to spare I&#8217;d
definitely consider&nbsp;trying&nbsp;it.</p>
