[Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][lvsthw] is a short book for users of the Vim
editor who want to learn how to customize Vim.

It's currently a work in progress, so it's incomplete and and you should expect
mistakes.

It will always be available for free online.  Once it's finished you'll be able
to buy paperback and eBook versions for fairly cheap.
