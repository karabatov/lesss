Well, I've redesigned the site again. This time it's all me. I built the site
from the ground up with [Django][] and [Python][]. Why? Several reasons:

* I already pay for hosting at [WebFaction][] for other sites so also paying
  [Squarespace][] for my personal one was too wasteful.
* I wanted to practice designing another site with [Django][].
* I wanted more flexibility than [Squarespace][] supports and I'm not afraid
  to get my hands dirty with code.

If you want to know more about how I created the site, check out the site's
[project page][].

Moving over
-----------

I've tried to make transitioning to the new site as easy as possible. For
example, I set up the urls so that links to the entries on the old blog will
redirect to entries on the new one if they exist.

Coming soon
-----------

I'm going to work on porting over more of the old blog entries in the next day
or two. I don't want to bring them all over; just the best ones.

I'm also going to implement an RSS feed that will encompass projects and blog
entries.

Let me know what you think!
