A while ago [Vincent Driessen][] posted an example of [a successful git
branching model][gitbranch]. A lot of git users found that article very
helpful, and [Dirkjan Ochtman][] [told me][djctweet] I should write a similar
article for Mercurial users.

I decided that I didn't want to just write a single entry about one branching
workflow. Mercurial is flexible enough to support many different workflows and
some of them will fit a given project better than others. Instead I'm going to
write a series of posts, each one about a particular workflow.

I'm going to start off with the simplest example I can think of: "Don't worry
about branching at all, just deal with it whenever it happens."

**Note:** In this series I'm going to assume you're comfortable with basic
Mercurial commands and you know how Mercurial's various forms of branching
work. If you need some review on Mercurial's commands you should look at the
[hg book][]. If you need more information on branching concepts you might like
my [Guide to Branching in Mercurial][hgbranching].

[TOC]

"Branch as Needed" in a Nutshell
--------------------------------

The general idea of this workflow is that you don't worry about branching
until it actually happens.

The benefit is that it takes no extra work up front and keeps things very
simple.

The drawback is that it doesn't scale very well. It's great for small projects
but it for larger ones you'll probably want something a bit more structured.

An Example Scenario
-------------------

This workflow is most suited to small projects. Here's a sample repository
with only a single, linear series of changes:

![Sample Repository Diagram](/media/images{{ parent_url }}/hg-branching-1-start.png "Sample Repository")

In this example there's mostly just a single developer (you) working on the
project to add features, fix bugs, etc.

The repository is online so other people can get the code. They can add
features and fix bugs if they want, but it doesn't happen very often because
it's a small project.

**Note:** I find it helpful to have graphs of the changesets in a repository
so I can see what's going on. If you want some nice, quick ASCII-art graphs of
your own repositories you can [use the graphlog extension][glog].

Branch Setup
------------

In this workflow you don't do any up-front setup at all. Just use Mercurial as
you normally would, committing your changes along the way and pushing them to
somewhere where other people can get them (like [BitBucket][]).

[BitBucket]: http://bitbucket.org/

Contributing to the Project
---------------------------

Let's say someone else starts using your project and finds a bug. They go
ahead and fix the bug themselves and commit a changeset for the fix. They
could then push their copy of the repository to somewhere public (like their
own BitBucket account) and it would look something like this:

![Contributor Repository Diagram](/media/images{{ parent_url }}/hg-branching-1-other.png "Contributor Repository")

Once their changes are somewhere public they can email you and say:

> Hey, I fixed a bug in your project.
> 
> The fix is changeset be3063198fea in my copy of your repository at
> http://.../

Merging Changes from Contributors
---------------------------------

When you get an email like this you would head over to their repository and
take a look at the changeset. If you decide it's good and want to incorporate
it into your own repository it's as simple as running `hg pull
http://their/repo/`.

If you haven't made any new changes your repository would now look exactly
like theirs. You can update to the new tip and continue working as usual.

What if you've made changes between the time they cloned (or last pulled) your
repository and the time you read the email & pulled their changes? In that
case your repository will look like this after you pull from them:

![Sample Repository Before Merging Diagram](/media/images{{ parent_url }}/hg-branching-1-needs-merge.png "Sample Repository Before Merging")

Because John's bugfix changeset and your refactoring changeset both have the
same parent there are now two "anonymous branches" in your repository. This
doesn't bother Mercurial at all -- repositories can have as many "anonymous
branches" as you like.

You'll probably want to merge these branches, so you'd run `hg update
a2125cb20c54` (if you weren't already there) and then `hg merge be3063198fea`
to merge John's bugfix with your new changes. The result would look like this:

![Sample Repository After Merging Diagram](/media/images{{ parent_url }}/hg-branching-1-after-merge.png "Sample Repository After Merging")

Now you're back to having just one head and you can continue working as usual,
with John's changes and your changes all merged together.

Summary
-------

This workflow is the simplest one possible. There's no up-front setup and it's
very easy for new people to contribute to the project -- they just clone,
commit, push, and tell you about their changes. It's great for small projects
with one main developer and the occasional contributor.

If you have a project with a lot of people working together this can get
pretty chaotic. Your repository graph will end up looking like a tangled mess.
In that case you'll want a workflow with a bit more structure.

I'm planning on writing at least two or three more posts about some more
complicated branching workflows in the future. If you have any specific
examples you think I should write about please let me know!
