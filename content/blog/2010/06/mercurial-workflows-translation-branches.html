This entry is the third in my series describing various [Mercurial][] workflows.
The [first][branch-as-needed] describes the simplest one: branching only when
necessary, and the [second][default-and-stable] describes the classic "default
and stable" workflow.

I've been experimenting with another workflow lately and it's proven itself to
be pretty useful, so I wanted to write about it.

A Real Example
--------------

I created the [hgtip.com][] site a while back as a resource for all those tiny
little tips that make working with Mercurial easier. People seemed to like it
and eventually there was some interest in translating the site to other
languages.

The site itself is a collection of flat files that are run through [Hyde][] to
generate a set of static HTML pages. The content of the site is held in
a [subrepo][] which people can clone to contribute without worrying about the
site's structure.

When coming up with a strategy for managing translations I had the following
requirements:

* Translations need to be version controlled. Version control is extremely
  helpful, so we need to use it.
* Contributing translations should be (almost) as easy as contributing to the
  main site. I didn't want it to be much more work than a simple clone, commit,
  push.
* I make typos when creating tips, and sometimes people comment with ideas
  I hadn't thought of, which I then add to the tips. When the main (English)
  version of a tip is updated it needs to be easy for translators to see
  exactly what changed so they can update their translations.

After thinking about the problem for a while I settled on using Mercurial's
named branches to manage translations.

Branch Structure
----------------

For the content of hgtip I (currently) have three branches: `default`, `ja`,
and `de`.

`default` contains the English version of the tips, while `ja` and `de` contain
the Japanese and German translations.

As other people translate the existing tips they commit to the appropriate
branch. When I publish the site to the server I can easily update to each
branch to render the content, one at a time.

When I add new tips I commit them to the `default` branch and merge `default`
into all the translation branches. This adds the new file to the translation
branches so it gets rendered (in English) on the other versions of the site.

When a translator is ready to translate any new tips, they can run `hg log -b
THEIRBRANCH` to see what's been merged into the branch and find the tips they
need to translate.

Here's a diagram to help explain what's going on. As new tips are added they
get merged into the translation branches. When a translator has time to
translate a tip, they commit to their branch.

Linebreaks
----------

There's one small issue that arises with a workflow like this, and it happens
when I fix a typo (or add an update) in an existing tip.

If I fix a typo in `beginner/sometip.html`, it will cause a merge conflict when
someone tries to merge it into a translation branch. This is generally a good
thing because it shows the translator where the change was. They can then fix
the conflict by changing the translation, commit, and everything works.

The tricky part is that Mercurial will only show line-by-line diffs. If each
paragraph of a tip is a single line, Mercurial will only tell you the paragraph
that changed. For large paragraphs this is annoying because you need to figure
out by hand exactly which word was modified.

To avoid this I always make sure that lines are hard-wrapped with linebreaks.
You can do this easily by pressing `Ctrl-Q` in TextMate or using `gqip` in vim.
I'm sure Emacs has an equivalent as well.

This doesn't affect the output because hgtip uses [Markdown][] and Markdown
ignores single linebreaks. If you're using another markup language this might
be a bigger problem for you than it is for me.

A Work in Progress
------------------

This is the first time I've ever used this branching structure and I haven't
hear about other people using it.  I'm sure there are some tricks that might
make things smoother, so if you have any advice I'd love to hear it!
