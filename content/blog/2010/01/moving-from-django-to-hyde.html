{% block article %}

Almost exactly one year ago I posted a blog entry about how I [rewrote this
site][rewrite] using [Django][]. It's a new year, and once again I've
rewritten the site.

If you've visited my site before you may have noticed some small style tweaks.
I've cleaned up a few things and I think the site looks better overall. The
biggest change, however, is that I completely rewrote the core -- this time
with [Hyde][].

Hyde is a "static site generator" written in [Python][], similar to
[Jekyll][], [Blatter][] and [Pilcrow][]. I chose it over the others because
it's written in Python (unlike Jekyll), more flexible than Blatter and more
mature than Pilcrow.

Rewriting an existing site that gets a decent amount of visitors is different
than creating a new site from scratch, so I decided to write this entry to
describe some of the issues I ran into and how I tackled them.

[TOC]

Why Static?
-----------

There are a couple of reasons I decided to switch to a static site.

### Less Memory Needed

I use [WebFaction][] for my web hosting, and with my current plan I have a
limit on how much memory I can use at any given time. Each Django site takes
up around 20mb of memory on the server.

By switching to a static set of HTML pages for my site I save those 20mb so I
can use them for something else (like a staging site for another project). My
site doesn't particularly *need* all of the functionality Django can provide,
so I figured I'd switch to a static site and save the memory.

[WebFaction]: {{links.webfaction}}

### Static Pages are Faster

My site doesn't get an enormous amount of traffic, so the Django instances
weren't really working very hard. Still, serving a static page through Apache
or nginx is always going to be faster than running it through Django.
Faster-loading pages is always a good thing, even if the speed increase isn't
very large.

### Easier to Maintain

This is the main reason I switched. Previously, to edit a blog entry I would
log in through Django's admin interface and edit the entry. With Hyde, I
simply edit a file (or create a new one) on my machine and then run a single
command to publish it.

Another problem with the old site is that I needed to be connected to the
internet to get to the admin interface, so I couldn't update entries (or
publish new ones) offline. I usually have an internet connection, but
occasionally I don't. Now I can edit as much as I like on my own machine and
only need a connection to publish the finished product.

### Easier to Backup

One more advantage of Hyde is that the site structure *and* content are all
held in the same place. I keep everything in a [Mercurial][] repository, and
so every time I push that repository somewhere it creates a full backup of the
site's code *and* content. If WebFaction's server catches on fire I still have
everything on my local machine (and on BitBucket).

I've toyed around with backing up Django's database tables when I had my old
site, but this new method is far less work.

[Mercurial]: {{links.mercurial}}

Getting Started
---------------

I wanted a fresh start when I was rewriting the site, so I went ahead and
created a brand new folder and Mercurial repository for it.

I used `hyde --init` to lay out a skeleton in the new folder. Then I stripped
out a lot of the default items that get added with `--init` and created the
directory structure I wanted to use, with stubs for each of the main content
files I knew I'd need.

Finally, I went ahead and filled some of the basic values in the `settings.py`
file.

Layout and Styling
------------------

Once I had a skeleton in place I started working on layout of the site.

### Cleanup

The templates created by `hyde --init` are functional, but when you look at
the code they're a mess. The indentation is strange and inconsistent and
there's trailing whitespace all over the place. I like clean code so I sat
down and cleaned everything up before I started making any real changes.

### Rewriting the Layout and Styles

After I finished cleaning up the templates I duplicated the HTML structure and
styles of the old site from scratch. The old site had gone through a bunch of
iterations and I was a bit sloppy in my editing, so there was a lot of cruft
that had snuck in. I wanted a truly *fresh* start for the site, so I buckled
down and did it all again.

### A New CSS Framework

Previously I used the [Blueprint CSS framework][blueprint] to make laying out
the site easier. Blueprint is a great framework, but it's more powerful than I
need for a site as simple as this one. The site now uses [Aardvark Legs][aal],
which is a much simpler framework that simply sets up a great vertical rhythm
and leaves you free to lay out the horizontal structure yourself.

### Pagination

Before the rewrite the list of blog entries used to be paginated. Hyde
supports pagination but I decided against using it because I simply don't
write enough to make it necessary. All the blog entries are now listed on a
single page, which means that you can use Cmd+F to find an article if you're
looking for something specific.

[aal]: {{links.aardvarklegs}}

Using Fabric to Type Less
-------------------------

I realized very quickly that typing `hyde -g -s . && hyde -w -s .` would get
old pretty quickly, so I installed [Fabric][] and wrote a fabfile.

Fabric is a tool written in Python that lets you define tasks and execute them
by running `fab taskname`. Fabfiles are pure Python, so you can build larger
tasks out of smaller ones very easily and do just about anything you want.
It's similar to [ant][], but without the excessive over-engineering.

You can view the [current fabfile][fabfile] on BitBucket. At the time of this
entry it looks like this:

    :::python
    from fabric.api import *
    import os
    import fabric.contrib.project as project

    PROD = 'sjl.webfactional.com'
    DEST_PATH = '/home/sjl/webapps/slc/'
    ROOT_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    DEPLOY_PATH = os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'deploy')

    def clean():
        local('rm -rf ./deploy')

    def regen():
        clean()
        local('hyde -g -s .')

    def serve():
        local('hyde -w -s .')

    def reserve():
        regen()
        serve()

    def smush():
        local('smusher ./media/images')

    @hosts(PROD)
    def publish():
        regen()
        project.rsync_project(
            remote_dir=DEST_PATH,
            local_dir=DEPLOY_PATH.rstrip('/') + '/',
            delete=True
        )

The task I use most often while developing is `fab reserve`, which regenerates
the site and then starts serving it so I can view the result in a browser.

I use `fab smush` whenever I add new images. This runs [smusher][] on all of
the images to optimize them without reducing quality.

When I'm ready to publish changes to the live site I run `fab publish`, which
will regenerate my local version and copy it up to the WebFaction server.

Moving the Content
------------------

The content of the old site (blog entries, projects, and static pages like the
[about page][]) was fairly easy to migrate over to the new one, because both
versions use [Markdown][] to format the text.

First I created an empty file for each page with a filename that matched the
"slug" (last part of the URL) of the old page. Then I manually copied over the
title, creation time and content for every page. I could have written a script
to do this, but I don't have enough pages on the site to make it worth the
time.

[about page]: /about/
[Markdown]: {{links.markdown}}

Converting the Comments
-----------------------

At this point the new site was looking very much like the old one. The styles
were (roughly) matching and the blog posts, entries, and static pages were all
rendered nicely.

The next big task was migrating all of the comments. Since the new site is
static it can't handle dynamic content like comments on its own, so I decided
to use [Disqus][]. I use Disqus for the comments on the [hg tip][] site and
it's very nice. For that site I used it from the beginning, but for this
rewrite I needed to somehow import all the old comments.

To migrate the comments over I used [django-disqus][], but there was a small
snag that I needed to deal with first.

When I first wrote the old site I was just getting back into Django after not
using it for a long time. I didn't know about Django's built-in comment
models, so I created my own. They weren't as good as Django's, but they did
the job and I didn't care enough to change them.

This became a problem when it was time to import the old comments into Disqus.
django-disqus only supports importing comments from Django's built-in comment
models. To work around this I first had to convert the old comments into
Django's built-in ones. I wrote a [small, hacky Python
script][convert-comments] to do it:

    :::python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from django.core.management import setup_environ
    import settings
    setup_environ(settings)
    
    from markdown import Markdown
    from django.contrib.comments.models import Comment
    from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
    from stevelosh.blog.models import Comment as BlogComment
    from stevelosh.projects.models import Comment as ProjectComment
    
    
    mdown = Markdown()
    
    site = Site.objects.all()[0]
    blog_comments = BlogComment.objects.filter(spam=False)
    project_comments = ProjectComment.objects.filter(spam=False)
    
    for bc in blog_comments:
        c = Comment()
        c.content_object = bc.entry
        c.user_name = bc.name
        c.comment = mdown.convert(bc.body)
        c.submit_date = bc.submitted
        c.site = site
        c.is_public = True
        c.is_removed = False
        c.save()
        # print 'http://%s%s' % (site.domain, c.content_object.get_absolute_url())
    
    for pc in project_comments:
        c = Comment()
        c.content_object = pc.project
        c.user_name = pc.name
        c.comment = mdown.convert(pc.body)
        c.submit_date = pc.submitted
        c.site = site
        c.is_public = True
        c.is_removed = False
        c.save()
        # print 'http://%s%s' % (site.domain, c.content_object.get_absolute_url())

Yes, it's ugly. No, I don't care. It was run once or twice locally and once on
the live server. It worked and I'll never need to run it again.

Once I had the comments converted I could use django-disqus to migrate them.
The import went very smoothly -- I ran one command and after a couple of
minutes everything was in Disqus. Once that finished it was just a matter of
adding the Disqus JavaScript to one of the templates.

Rewriting the Old URLs
----------------------

Since I was pretty much starting from scratch with this rewrite I decided to
clean up the URL structure of my blog. Previously a blog entry's URL looked
like this:

    :::text
    http://stevelosh.com/blog/entry/2009/08/30/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/

The `/entry/` part of the URL was useless -- it just took up space, so I got
rid of it. The year and month are useful to get an idea of how old an entry is
just by looking at the link, so I left them in. The day, however, probably
doesn't matter that much, so I took it out.

The new URLs look like this:

    :::text
    http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/

The problem with rewriting the URL structure is that there are already links
around the web pointing at my entries. I didn't want those old links to break,
so I crafted an [`.htaccess` file][htaccess] that would rewrite the old URLs
into the new ones:

    {% templatetag openblock %} if GENERATE_CLEAN_URLS {% templatetag closeblock %}
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase {% templatetag openvariable %} node.site.settings.SITE_ROOT {% templatetag closevariable %}
    
    # Old URLs
    RewriteRule ^blog/entry/(\d+)/(\d\d)/\d+/([^/]*)/?$ /blog/$1/$2/$3/ [R=301,L]
    RewriteRule ^blog/entry/(\d+)/(\d)/\d+/([^/]*)/?$ /blog/$1/0$2/$3/ [R=301,L]
    
    {% templatetag openblock %} hyde_listing_page_rewrite_rules {% templatetag closeblock %}
    
    # listing pages whose names are the same as their enclosing folder's
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}/$1.html -f
    RewriteRule ^([^/]*)/$ %{REQUEST_FILENAME}/$1.html
    
    # regular pages
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
    RewriteRule ^.*$ %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html
    
    {% templatetag openblock %} endif {% templatetag closeblock %}

Most of that file is the stock Hyde `.htaccess` file -- the two lines under `#
Old URLs` are the ones that I added. It took me a while to get it right
because I don't work with Apache's `mod_rewrite` very often, but it was worth
it to avoid breaking all of the old links.

Creating an RSS Feed
--------------------

I had an RSS feed for the old site which Django made very easy to set up. I
definitely needed a feed for the new site, and fortunately Hyde provides a
simple sample template that can be used to make an ATOM feed.

I cleaned up the whitespace and formatting of that template a bit, adjusted a
few variables for my needs, put it on [FeedBurner][] and everything was ready.

[FeedBurner]: http://www.feedburner.com/

Merging the Repositories
------------------------

The last step before I was finished was to merge the old and new repositories
together so I wouldn't lose any of the history. It's probably not *too*
important to keep the old site's history around, but I put a lot of work into
it over the past year and it has some sentimental value.

Fortunately it's very easy to [combine Mercurial repositories][combinerepos].
I just pulled the old repository into the new one, merged the old head into
the new one while discarding all the changes, and pushed it up to BitBucket.

Still to Come
-------------

At this point I felt the site was ready to be released, so I set up a new site
on WebFaction and used Fabric to deploy it.

I'm very happy with the result, but there are still a few things I'm going to
fix/change in the future.

### "Ago" Dates

**UPDATE:** This is done. I've started using [timeago.js][] to render the
"ago" dates.

If you look at the top of each blog entry and project there's a line beneath
the title that looks something like:

    :::text
    Posted on Monday, November 16, 2009 (1 month, 3 weeks ago).

The `(1 month, 3 weeks ago)` part of that line is something that I really
appreciate on blogs. When they just list the date I always have to do the math
in my head to figure out roughly how old something is.

With a static site, however, those times will quickly become inaccurate if I
don't regenerate and publish the site regularly. I'm still thinking about the
best way to work this out.

One option is to use a cron job on the WebFaction server to regenerate the
site every day, which would keep the times *fairly* accurate.

Another option would be to use a bit of JavaScript to calculate and render the
time when the page is loaded. This would make it *completely* accurate but
wouldn't work if someone is browsing with JavaScript turned off.

[timeago.js]: http://timeago.yarp.com/

### Categories

**UPDATE:** I've added categories.  Check out [this changeset][categorycset] to see what I had to do.

Right now all the blog entries (and projects) are listed in a single
chronological list. It would be great to break them up into categories so
people can easily find the articles they're interested in.

Hyde supports categories but I haven't spent the time to learn how to use them
yet. I also need to figure out a way to work a list of categories into the
design without cluttering things up too much.

[categorycset]: http://bitbucket.org/sjl/stevelosh/changeset/08d7552b6237/

### Use LessCSS

**UPDATE:** This is done.  The main style file now uses LessCSS.

[LessCSS][] is a language that extends CSS with some useful features like
variables, mixins, operations and nested rules. It can make the styles of a
site much, much cleaner.

Hyde includes a LessCSS "processor" that will automatically render your
LessCSS files into normal CSS. I'm planning on rewriting the site's styles in
LessCSS and using the processor once I get some free time.

[lesscss]: {{links.lesscss}}

The code is on [BitBucket][bb-repo] and [GitHub][gh-repo]. Feel free to poke
around and see how I've set things up. If you have questions or suggestions
I'd love to hear them!
